# SchoolDeviceManage
Android app as an end-of-year high school project
The project stems from the need to create an effective and easy-to-use application that allows the school staff of ITIS Leonardo Da Vinci to better manage the school's assets.
The application allows through the scanning of a QR code, previously affixed on the school assets, to retrieve information related to the room of origin, whether it has been borrowed, provide a photo, etc... In addition, the possibility of cataloging, through a special section, new assets, generating the QrCode and allowing its printing to be affixed on the same, has been provided.
